## Election-Audit Summary
The script that was written was very helpful in auditing the election results since it was a large data file. The script can be modified and used for any elections. If you wanted to know the number of voters for each candidate in a specific county, the script could be modified. This could be helpful to know where the candidates had a better turnout rate. Another example is if further details were given in the data file, then the code could be modified to show more results.
